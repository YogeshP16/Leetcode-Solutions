You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x.
Record a new score of x.
'+'.
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D'.
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C'.
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.


class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        stack =[]
        for ops in operations:
            if ops == '+':
                stack.append(stack[-1] + stack[-2])
            elif ops == "D":
                stack.append(2*stack[-1])
            elif ops == "C":
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(int(ops))
        return sum(stack)
